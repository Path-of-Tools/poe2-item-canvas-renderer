# poe2-item-canvas-renderer

* parse CTRL+C item with `Path-of-Tools/poe-item-parser`
* render to a canvas with `Automattic/node-canvas`
* node-canvas is compatible with the whatwg canvas spec, so this should work for web canvas as well with minimal changes
* test with `node test.js`

# Notes

Custom local parser in `package.json`: `"poe-item-parser": "file:../poe-item-parser"`
